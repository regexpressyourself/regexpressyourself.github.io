<p>
In Illinois our primary competitors are Northern Illinois University and UI-Chicago.  Both have Ph.D. programs and so also emphasize research.  Within our region, SEMO and Murray State also attract students from the southern Illinois region.  	"

<p>
Unlike SEMO and Murray State, we have a doctoral program.  Only departments with faculty actively involved in research provide doctoral programs.  Therefore, students at SIU can work with faculty that are engaged in the highest level of scholarly activity.  Such experiences will especially help students that want to continue their education at the graduate level.
</p>

<p>
We specialize in different areas than do NIU and UIC.  Our specializations at the undergraduate level include financial economics, law and economics, and international economics.  At the graduate level we offer a fields in monetary economics, international economics and development economics (which considers economic issues in poorer countries)."	"

<p>
Our program provides the flexibility for students to tailor their economics major in various ways.  In addition to the specializations mentioned above, students can shape their economics degree in different ways.  The rigor of our upper level econometrics course allows those wanting to go to graduate school or to apply sophisticated statistical techniques when analyzing data can do so.  Those wanting to follow a different path can design their course schedule to best prepare them for work in business.  With law and economics becoming more popular at law schools, students wanting to go to law school can begin this line of study at SIU.
</p>

<p>
Regarding less tangible characteristics, our faculty provide a stable, friendly environment for our students.  We have had very little turnover in the last decade so students have not had to scramble to find other professors when someone leaves.  Moreover, our faculty are very friendly and personable.  We enjoy talking with students.  Our students appreciate the ability to approach us when they have questions about course material or their future endeavors."	"

We are a department devoted to teaching and research.  Our professors are active scholars and respected historians in their fields, but they are also very devoted to teaching.  I have heard from MANY majors that we are a very hands-on department.  We are teacher-scholars as professors, and the students benefit from close-contact with faculty, small classes, and exciting opportunities for extra-curricular events with fellow majors.

See prior answer.  Importantly, too, our majors GET JOBS.  It is key for prospective students to know that HISTORY is all around great major for many career choices.  They need to know that a pre-professional field will not place them in any better standing with respect to business, law, government work, teaching, etc etc than a history major.  We also provide credit for hands-on work/internships in the community and beyond. 	"

While a two-year college starts students on a paralegal professional path, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale takes the career path to the next level, offering an American Bar Association-approved bachelor degree paralegal studies program.  Your bachelor degree offers a choice of two paths, either pursuing a career as a professional paralegal or choosing instead our pre-law specialization to go on to law school.
</p>

<p>
Our pre-law specialization is particularly helpful in preparing for law school.  We provide excellent law school preparation because we cover from a practical perspective many of the same courses a law student will be taking the student’s first few years in law school.
</p>

<p>
As a result, our graduates who go on to law school consistently report they have an advantage over other law students who came to law school from other undergraduate majors. We get tremendous feedback from our graduates’ experiences in law school. In today’s competitive legal market, every edge is a blessing.
</p>

<p>
Our general paralegal path is superior in that our students are specifically trained for practical performance in a professional setting immediately upon graduation. In your final semester, you will work in an internship for a law office. When it comes time to seek employment upon graduation, students with a four-year bachelor degree in paralegal studies have an edge over those who have completed two-year degrees; more-so, if that is a bachelor degree from an ABA-approved program.
</p>

<p>
At SIU Carbondale, Paralegal Studies is the only undergraduate program where every teacher is a licensed attorney.  Among other requirements, Paralegal students must take Introduction to Law, two Legal Writing and Research classes, Civil Procedure, Trusts and Estates, Business Entities, Family Law, Torts, Bankruptcy and Creditors’ Rights, and Technologies in the Law.  Criminal law, criminal procedure, contracts, and property law are also popular courses offered to our paralegal students.
</p>

<p>
Students who wish to move out of the area from where their associate degrees were earned will improve their competitive edge in the field by obtaining their ABA-approved paralegal Bachelor degree from SIU Carbondale.
Why Southern Illinois University Carbondale? Paralegal Studies at Southern Illinois Carbondale has been in existence more than 30 years, and we became an American Bar Association (ABA)-approved program in 1983. According to I-Quest, SIUC’s Paralegal Studies has consistently upheld a high retention to graduation rate. In other words, students who start our program see it through and graduate with their Bachelor degrees.

We are located in the heart of the Shawnee national forest and boast the most beautiful autumn colors. Giant City State Park and the Shawnee National Forest offer more great and fascinating walking trails than you can manage in four years.  They are all worth experiencing, from a short trail like Indian Creek Trail to an all-day hike through Little Grand Canyon. From the Alto Pass overlook, on a clear day – and there are so many clear days – you can view four states at the same time.
</p>

<p>
There are 12 incredible wineries along the Shawnee Wine Trail that offer live music and frequent art exhibits and pleasant atmospheres for many hours of focused studying.
</p>

<p>
The campus lake trail and Thompson Woods add to the truly lovely campus that is Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. The classrooms include the most up-to-date technology, with smart boards and computer lab classrooms for our computer-assisted legal research and law in technology courses.

SIU Carbondale is home to Morris Library. At a cost close to $60 million, the beautiful seven-story library is huge and holds more than 2.6 million volumes, 36,000 current periodicals and serials, and over 3.6 million microform units. Morris Library provides access to the latest technologies, computers, study areas, resources of all types, to the statewide automated library system, and to an array of electronic sources, including LEXIS Academic.
</p>

<p>
One of the greatest benefits of SIU’s Paralegal Studies is our proximity to the Southern Illinois School of Law, which is right on campus. Our relationship with the law school includes regular access to the Lesar Law School Law Library, where you will have hands-on legal research training using hardbound reporters before transitioning into computer-assisted legal research training.
The diversity of our students in everything from age to personal backgrounds to individual talents strengthens the quality of education shared by all. Although these figures vary from year to year, our paralegal studies program traditionally averages 63% female and 37% male. An average 40% of our students are minorities.
</p>

<p>
LEX, Lambda Epsilon Chi, is our national honors society and accepts paralegal students who complete at least 80 hours of course work and maintain a cumulative 3.5 overall GPA.  LEX Students are honored at our annual Paralegal Studies banquet at the Giant City Lodge.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of each semester, Paralegal Studies has a pizza party orientation/welcome to the program.  We invite all new students, faculty, and staff, OPS officers, mentors, and the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts.
Each new student is provided a mentor to help the new student get his or her bearings and find his or her way around campus and to answer any questions about the school or program the student might have.  The mentors are volunteers from among the seniors in our program.
</p>

<p>
The Organization of Paralegal Students, OPS, is our registered student organization, which meets monthly; and at each meeting, a speaker who is connected with the profession speaks to the members.  Speakers also include representatives from the University who explain how to get involved in some of the many additional activities available on and off campus.  OPS tours annually some of the larger law firms in the St. Louis area and the federal penitentiary in Marion, Illinois.
</p>

<p>
Each year, we have a golf scramble to raise funds for the scholarship and activities funds, and you are all invited.  This happens in October.  We also have a periodic fund-raising trivia night.  We have great turnouts at each event, and there are a wide variety of wonderful giveaways and prizes at each.
Paralegal Studies offers three program scholarships.  The College of Liberal Arts, where Paralegal Studies resides, has a wide variety of additional available scholarships.
Every Paralegal Studies’ student is on a general listserv for paralegal students, which provides students with regular announcements that they can easily access and readily respond to.  All Paralegal Studies classes are supported by the Desire2Learn web interface with continuously posts syllabi, handouts, assignments, Policy and Procedure guidelines, current absentee and grading records, and emergency procedures.
</p>

<p>
Our website provides information for students and alumni, including an active posting of job opportunities. Following graduation, we assist Paralegal Studies’ students by keeping track of and posting job placement opportunities.
Paralegal Studies has an Advisory Committee made up of practicing attorneys and paralegals, community representatives, and faculty. The Committee provides valuable support to the program, including evaluation of ongoing activities within the program and provides information regarding the current direction of the paralegal field and the practice of law.
Our Southern Illinois University Carbondale mascot is the Saluki! For those of you who do not know, a Saluki is a sighthound deep-chested, long-legged lean and loyal canine. In ancient Egypt, Salukis were accepted as the finest animals a family could possibly possess. Known for their speed and hunting skills, Salukis are the oldest pure-breed dogs in the world with records dating back to 3600 B.C.
</p>

<p>
If you are a sports fan, hold onto you cap.  Our Saluki men’s team sports include baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field. Our Saluki women’s team sports include basketball, cross-country, golf, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.
Some of you may know that our Saluki Football has produced 32 National Football League players and 26 NFL Draft picks. For example, Brandon Jacobs, who spent the majority of his career with the New York Giants, is a former Saluki and a two-time NFL Super Bowl champion. Our Saluki Men’s Basketball has produced 9 NBA players.
SIU Carbondale’s Paralegal Studies program has 34 credit hours of core major courses. It is likely you will have taken a number of these courses where you are studying right now.
</p>

<p>
When you enroll in our Paralegal Studies program, many of your courses will transfer over through what we call an articulation agreement between our two schools. The rule is, though, that even as you transfer completed courses over, you will still be required to take at least 15 hours from our core Paralegal major courses in order to achieve the Bachelor degree from SIU Carbondale. You will also have to have completed at least 42 300-400-level Liberal Arts courses at four-year institution. The Paralegal courses you take at SIU Carbondale will satisfy most of these."	"

Criminal law, criminal procedure, contracts, and property law are also popular courses offered to our paralegal students.
</p>

<p>
The availability of paralegal-related jobs is so great in part because paralegals work not only in private law offices, but also in corporations and administrative agencies. Corporate entities of all sizes, from Coca Cola and Microsoft to Proto Labs and Ancestry.com have legal departments, and these legal departments employ attorneys and paralegals.
</p>

<p>
All of the prison systems and administrative agencies like the CIA, FBI, IRS, and Homeland Security have legal departments and employ paralegals and attorneys.  Medical facilities of all sizes employ paralegals and nurse paralegals, as do the insurance agencies.
</p>

<p>
Because of the wide variety of paralegal positions around the world, paralegals have the flexibility to trade up in their own firms or to move from firm to firm and state to state.  There are full-time paralegal positions and part-time positions to accommodate lifestyles, and paralegals even work from their own homes electronically communicating with their employers, even employers from foreign nations.
</p>

<p>
Our students are drawn to the program especially in these economic times because this is a profession where they will not only be able to find employment, but they will be able to keep employment for the rest of their lives, and likely no matter where they end up living."	"

In pure math, we have active researchers and research opportunities for students, as well as graduate-level classes.  We also have an actuarial program among our offerings, which in many places is not differentiated from the math program; one difference there is that we let them pass more of the professional licensing exams and enter the profession at a higher level.  In math education, we have strong collaboration between the math department and the school of education, so that students don't get stuck in between, and we have on both sides some of the best math and science education people around.
