# Iframer

Iframer is a small pet project to quickly get an iframe tag from a YouTube URL.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Iframer came from my training faculty at my school to use our website's content management system. When adding YouTube videos to university sites, an iframe tag is needed. Creating a site to quickly get these tags will make it easier for university faculty to add videos to their sites.
